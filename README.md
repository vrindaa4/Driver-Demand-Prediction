## 🧠 About the Project

This project focuses on predicting the **demand for drivers** in a specific region using historical data. The goal is to help ride-sharing companies like Uber/Ola optimize their driver allocation and reduce wait times.

---

## 🧾 Problem Statement

Ride-hailing platforms often struggle with under or over-supply of drivers during peak and off-peak hours. This project aims to predict the **number of drivers required in a region** based on factors like:

- Day of week  
- Time of day  
- Weather conditions  
- Previous demand trends  
- Holiday or event days

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Model Evaluation**: RMSE, R² Score, Cross-validation  
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
Name: Uber Pickups in New York City
Source: NYC Open Data / Kaggle

The dataset includes:
- Timestamps  
- Number of drivers requested  
- Temperature, rainfall  
- Event indicators (e.g., public holidays)  
- Region identifiers (if applicable)

---

## 🔍 Approach

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Converted timestamps to useful features like hour, weekday

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized peak hours  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Trend and seasonality detection

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Lag features for time-series context  
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables

4. **Modeling**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - XGBoost Regressor (best performance)

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - GridSearchCV on top models

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - RMSE and R² Score  
   - 5-fold cross-validation

## 📈 Model Evaluation

| Model               | RMSE      | R² Score |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|
| Linear Regression   | 23.5      | 0.61     |
| Random Forest       | 17.2      | 0.84     |
| XGBoost Regressor   | **15.8**  | **0.87** |

> *XGBoost gave the most accurate predictions with the best generalization.*
